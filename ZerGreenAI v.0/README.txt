ZerGreenAI

Written by Eric Hall

Using the BWAPI and BWEM libraries
-----------------------------

The AI requires that the files required for BWEM be placed in the folder Source/BWEM/ and the files for EasyBMP (used in BWEM) be placed in the folder Source/EasyBMP_1.06/

It also requirs that the files required for BWAPI be placed in the files ../include and ../lib

If someone other than me wants to try to compile this AI they should expect to have to put in a little work.
